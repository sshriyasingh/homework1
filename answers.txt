What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merges are non-destructive and preserve branch history. When you merge one branch into another, Git creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. The commit history of both branches is preserved.

On the other hand rebases rewrite commit history, have a clearer history, and have a potential for conflict resolution. Additionally, they may cause confusion in shared branches. If multiple people are working on the same branch, rebasing can cause confusion for other team members.
